I like donuts, but I would never recommend making them at home — unless they are _graffe_, an insanely delicious Napoletan treat made partially from mashed potatoes. It's a surprising and simple recipe, but the result is impossibly airy, shimmering with granulated sugar and best eaten immediately alongside a foamy cappucino.

Recipes will surely vary from one Italian grandmother to the next, but I remain loyal to the charming and stoutly _nonna_ who first taught me.

As always with baking recipes, a scale makes preparing the dough extremely quick. For frying, use a deep but small frying pan with sunflower or grapeseed oil. And have a shallow bowl of granulated white sugar ready: breakfast or brunch guests will love to give warm donuts a sublime crunchy and sweet exterior themselves before eating.


#### Recipe

- 25 grams sugar
- 250g cup warm water
- 25 grams yeast

- 500 grams flour
- 500 grams potato, boiled until soft and mashed or riced
- 3 eggs



### Dough Preparation

Mix first three ingredients in mixing bowl to activate yeast. Then add flour, mashed or riced boiled potatos, and eggs. Mix and knead gently until combined, then rest either for 3 hours on your kitchen counter, or overnight in your refridgertor. While it's resting, keep the dough in the same mixing bowl to minimize cleanup, and cover it with a porous kitchen towel so the yeast can breath and work its magic.


### Shaping

Once the dough has risen, shape pieces of it into balls with your palms, then stick your finger through the middle, and spin to create a smooth loop. Video example below:

### Cooking

Set a deep but small frying pan on medium heat with plenty of sunflower or grapeseed oil (canola is fine too) and wait about 10 minutes. If the oil is smoking or turning brown, adjust by turning down the heat or moving pan away from heat completely.

Fry shaped donuts until golden brown in sunflower or vegetable oil, about 2-4 minutes. Let cool slightly on an absorbant towel, then gently roll warm donut in shallow bowl of granulated sugar and serve immediately.
